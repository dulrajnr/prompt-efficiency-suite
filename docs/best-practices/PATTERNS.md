# Prompt Patterns Guide

This guide describes the various prompt patterns supported by the Prompt Efficiency Suite and how to use them effectively.

## Basic Patterns

### 1. Basic Prompt

The simplest form of prompt with minimal structure.

```text
System: You are a helpful assistant.
Context: This is the background information.
Instruction: Help me with this task.
Example: Here's an example.
```

### 2. Chain of Thought

Prompts that encourage step-by-step reasoning.

```text
System: You are a helpful assistant.
Context: This is the background information.
Instruction: Help me with this task.
Let's think about this step by step:
1. First, we need to understand the problem
2. Then, we can identify the key components
3. Finally, we can develop a solution
Example: Here's an example of the thought process.
```

### 3. Few-Shot Learning

Prompts that include multiple examples to guide the model.

```text
System: You are a helpful assistant.
Context: This is the background information.
Instruction: Help me with this task.
Example 1: Here's the first example.
Example 2: Here's the second example.
Example 3: Here's the third example.
```

### 4. Zero-Shot Learning

Prompts that rely on the model's existing knowledge without examples.

```text
System: You are a helpful assistant.
Context: This is the background information.
Instruction: Help me with this task.
```

### 5. Role Play

Prompts that assign a specific role to the model.

```text
System: You are a helpful assistant.
Context: This is the background information.
Instruction: Help me with this task.
Role: You are an expert in this field.
Example: Here's an example of the role play.
```

### 6. Hybrid

Combines multiple patterns for enhanced effectiveness.

```text
System: You are a helpful assistant.
Context: This is the background information.
Instruction: Help me with this task.
Let's think about this step by step:
1. First, we need to understand the problem
2. Then, we can identify the key components
3. Finally, we can develop a solution
Example 1: Here's the first example.
Example 2: Here's the second example.
Example 3: Here's the third example.
Role: You are an expert in this field.
```

## Advanced Patterns

### 1. Self-Consistency

Prompts that generate multiple solutions and select the most consistent one.

```text
System: You are a helpful assistant.
Context: This is the background information.
Instruction: Help me with this task.
Generate multiple solutions and select the most consistent one.
Example: Here's an example of the process.
```

### 2. Tree of Thoughts

Prompts that explore multiple reasoning paths.

```text
System: You are a helpful assistant.
Context: This is the background information.
Instruction: Help me with this task.
Let's explore different approaches:
Approach 1: First approach
Approach 2: Second approach
Approach 3: Third approach
Example: Here's an example of the process.
```

### 3. ReAct

Prompts that combine reasoning and action.

```text
System: You are a helpful assistant.
Context: This is the background information.
Instruction: Help me with this task.
Let's reason and act:
1. Think about the problem
2. Take action based on reasoning
3. Observe the results
4. Adjust if needed
Example: Here's an example of the process.
```

## Pattern Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Pattern

1. **Basic Pattern**
   - Simple, straightforward tasks
   - When the model has sufficient context
   - For well-defined problems

2. **Chain of Thought**
   - Complex reasoning tasks
   - When step-by-step thinking is needed
   - For problems requiring logical deduction

3. **Few-Shot Learning**
   - When examples are crucial
   - For tasks with specific formats
   - When consistency is important

4. **Zero-Shot Learning**
   - When the model has strong prior knowledge
   - For simple, well-defined tasks
   - When examples might be confusing

5. **Role Play**
   - When domain expertise is needed
   - For specialized tasks
   - When perspective matters

6. **Hybrid**
   - Complex tasks requiring multiple approaches
   - When different aspects need different patterns
   - For maximum effectiveness

### Pattern Combinations

1. **Chain of Thought + Few-Shot**
   - Complex tasks requiring examples
   - When both reasoning and examples are important

2. **Role Play + Chain of Thought**
   - Expert tasks requiring step-by-step reasoning
   - When domain knowledge and logic are needed

3. **Few-Shot + Zero-Shot**
   - When some examples are helpful but not all are needed
   - For tasks with mixed complexity

## Best Practices

1. **Pattern Selection**
   - Choose patterns based on task complexity
   - Consider the model's capabilities
   - Match patterns to task requirements

2. **Pattern Implementation**
   - Keep patterns clear and consistent
   - Use appropriate formatting
   - Include necessary context

3. **Pattern Evaluation**
   - Test patterns with different models
   - Compare effectiveness
   - Iterate and improve

4. **Pattern Maintenance**
   - Keep patterns up to date
   - Document pattern usage
   - Share successful patterns

## Pattern Analysis

The Prompt Efficiency Suite can analyze prompts for pattern usage and effectiveness:

```python
from prompt_efficiency_suite import PromptAnalyzer

analyzer = PromptAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze_prompt(
    prompt="Your prompt here",
    metrics=["pattern_effectiveness"]
)

# Print pattern analysis
for pattern_type, patterns in result.pattern_analysis.items():
    if patterns:
        print(f"\n{pattern_type}:")
        for pattern in patterns:
            print(f"  - {pattern}")
```

## Pattern Optimization

1. **Identify Patterns**
   - Use the analyzer to identify existing patterns
   - Understand pattern effectiveness
   - Find improvement opportunities

2. **Optimize Patterns**
   - Adjust pattern structure
   - Improve pattern clarity
   - Enhance pattern effectiveness

3. **Test Patterns**
   - Compare before and after
   - Measure improvements
   - Document changes

4. **Iterate Patterns**
   - Continue optimization
   - Share improvements
   - Build pattern library
