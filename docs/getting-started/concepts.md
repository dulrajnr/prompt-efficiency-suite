# Basic Concepts

## Overview

This guide explains the fundamental concepts and terminology used throughout the Prompt Efficiency Suite.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Prompts

A prompt is a text input that guides an AI model's response. In the Prompt Efficiency Suite, prompts are:

- Analyzed for quality and effectiveness
- Optimized for cost and performance
- Translated between different models
- Managed and versioned

### 2. Models

Models are AI systems that process prompts. The suite supports:

- GPT-4
- Claude-2
- Custom models
- Model translation

### 3. Analysis

Prompt analysis evaluates:

- Quality metrics
- Token usage
- Cost estimates
- Performance indicators

### 4. Optimization

Prompt optimization focuses on:

- Cost reduction
- Quality maintenance
- Performance improvement
- Pattern recognition

## Key Components

### 1. CLI

The Command Line Interface provides:

- Prompt analysis
- Cost estimation
- Repository scanning
- Model translation

### 2. Web UI

The web interface offers:

- Dashboard visualization
- Prompt management
- Cost analytics
- Benchmark tracking

### 3. IDE Plugins

IDE integration provides:

- In-editor analysis
- Real-time optimization
- Cost tracking
- Pattern suggestions

### 4. Orchestrator

The orchestrator service manages:

- Model selection
- Load balancing
- Cost optimization
- Performance monitoring

## Features

### 1. Analysis Features

- Quality scoring
- Token counting

- Performance improvement
- Pattern application

### 3. Management Features

- Version control
- Cost tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Pattern management

## Terminology

### 1. Quality Metrics

- **Clarity**: How well the prompt communicates its intent
- **Completeness**: Whether all necessary information is included
- **Consistency**: How well the prompt maintains its focus
- **Effectiveness**: How well the prompt achieves its goal

### 2. Cost Metrics

- **Token Count**: Number of tokens in the prompt
- **Cost per Token**: Cost associated with each token
- **Total Cost**: Overall cost of using the prompt
- **Cost Efficiency**: Cost-to-quality ratio

### 3. Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: Time taken to process the prompt
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful responses
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed responses
- **Resource Usage**: System resources consumed

## Best Practices

### 1. Prompt Writing

- Be clear and specific
- Include necessary context
- Use consistent formatting
- Test and iterate

### 2. Cost Management

- Monitor token usage
- Optimize when necessary
- Set budget limits
- Track spending

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Use appropriate models
- Monitor response times
- Handle errors gracefully
- Scale resources as needed

## Integration Concepts

### 1. API Integration
