"""This module implements "Local" classes that mimic their associated `cloudpathlib` non-local
counterparts but use the local filesystem in place of cloud storage. They can be used as drop-in
replacements, with the intent that you can use them as mock or monkepatch substitutes in your
tests. See ["Testing code that uses cloudpathlib"](../../testing_mocked_cloudpathlib/) for usage
examples.
