The API documentation provides details about the REST MACRO_4 system. Following REST conventions, the API uses JSON for all request and response payloads. JWT token-based authentication is mandatory for accessing any endpoint. The base URL for the API is https://api.example.com/v1. To prevent abuse, rate limiting is implemented at MACRO_7 API key. All API responses include standard HTTP status codes and adhere to the JSON:API specification for error handling. Cross-origin requests are supported through CORS, and comprehensive logging is available for debugging and monitoring purposes.
