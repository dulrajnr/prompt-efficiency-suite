This API documentation describes the REST endpoints for the user management system. The API follows standard REST conventions and uses JSON for request and response payloads. Authentication is required for all endpoints and is handled through JWT tokens. The base URL for all endpoints is https://api.example.com/v1. Rate limiting is enforced at 100 requests per minute per API key. All responses include standard HTTP status codes and follow the JSON:API specification for error handling. The API supports CORS for cross-origin requests and includes detailed logging for debugging purposes.
